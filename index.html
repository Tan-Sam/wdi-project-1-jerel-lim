            <h1>Game Objective and Game Rules</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>The aim of the game is to accumulate a higher point total than the dealer, but without going over 21. You compute your score by adding the values of your individual cards.</li>

              <li>The cards 2 through 10 have their face value, J, Q, and K are worth 10 points each, and the Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (player's choice).</li>

              <li>
                Two cards are dealt for the player and dealer upon placing of bet. A blackjack happens when the point total of the initial two cards dealt adds to 21, without any additional cards. When this happens, the winner is the side that obtains a blackjack, and the round is over.
              </li>
              <li>
                The player gets to play his/her moves first before the dealer(drawing additional cards or passing). If player card point total exceeds 21 upon additional draw of cards, player loses the game immediately. Upon passing by player, the dealer will then play his moves(drawing additional cards or passing). When both sides end their moves, all hands are opened and the winner is then determined by the by the side that has a higher point total, but without going over 21.

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Player receives 1000 credits at start of game. Place your desired bet amount before each round.
                </li>
                <li>Each hand will result in one of the following events for the player:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Lose - the player's bet is taken by the dealer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Win - the player wins as much as he bet. If you bet $10, you win $10 from the dealer (plus you keep your original bet, of course.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Tie - the hand is a draw. The player keeps his bet, neither winning nor losing money.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
